# Telegram Scraper

Telegram Scraper is a program code written in Python that allows you to display information about the channel, namely: the number of subscribers; the average number of views of five posts that were posted more than 24 hours ago; number of posts in 30 days. This project will help interested creators, managers, or the like to learn analytics about the channel.

## Installation

In the requirements.txt file you can find the libraries that were used and install them using

```bash
pip install telethon
```

## Usage

Add your list of channels to the channel_links.txt file, and then in the info_user file insert your api_id and api_hash, which you can create on the [official Telegram website](https://my.telegram.org/apps).
